# MV (Mitral Valve) 3D segmentation

## Automatic mitral valve segmentation from 3D transesophageal echocardiography (3DTEE)

This repository shows the implementation of a 3D CNN for multi-class segmentation of MV substructures (annulus, anterior
leaflet and posterior leaflet) at end-systole (ES) frame from 3DTEE.
